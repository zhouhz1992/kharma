This is a Mathematica package for reading and post-processing data generated by Kharma.

To make the package available to Mathematica, you need to add the path of the package to the
$Path
variable in Mathematica: First, type
FileNameJoin[{$UserBaseDirectory, "Kernel", "init.m"}]
in Mathematica to locate this "init.m" file. Then, add line
AppendTo[$Path, "your/kharma/home/mathematica"]
in this file and save it. Restart the Mathematica kernel and it should work.
To use the package, you need to call Needs["kh`"] at the beginning of a notebook or a script.
Alternatively, if you don't want to modify init.m, you may also call
Needs["kh`","path/to/this/package"]

To see all available functions, call khFunctions[].
To extract help information of a function, type a question mark followed by the function name;
e.g., ?readTS

About running on clusters:
A sample script is provided. Remember to load the Mathematica module by, for example,
module load mathematica
and then put the package in the right path. Modify the shebang according to
which wolfram
, and then you can easily run the script by saying
./sample_script.wls

Some important notes:
1. Each time you have updated or modified the package, remember to fully quit the kernel and then
reload the packages. Calling Needs after the package has been loaded will NOT reload it.
